Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to human or animal intelligence. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.

The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.

AI applications include advanced web search engines (such as Google), recommendation systems (such as used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (such as Tesla), generative AI (such as ChatGPT), creative tools (such as AI-enhanced or generated art and music), and superhuman ability in playing strategy games (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.
