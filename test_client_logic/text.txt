Since ancient times, people living in a collective have been thinking about the peculiarities and regularities of joint life, striving to ensure its organization and stability.
. The number of terms by which the forms of people's joint activity are denoted has been increasing over time.
. Many of them are well known. A group of land-
owners living close to each other and connected in some
cases by a common economy was called a community (world,
-survey). Joint residence of people in one place with collective
lective solution of communal issues is called a community.
. Along with these notions, there is also the notion of community.
It is easy to see that all three words are homonyms and
are based on the notion of “common”, i.e. uniting people into a group. Such a grouping must, of course,
be based on a common interest for all members of the group. For example, the audience in a movie theater is united by the interest in watching
movies. Workers in a labor group come together to work together
. Adherents of certain political views form a political party.
.
Students go to classes at school, and then some of them go
to the sports section, and others to the drama
club.
As we can see, the common interest is present in all the examples given
. However, at the end of watching the movie, the viewers
will separate and will not meet again. The construction crew will break up
after the work is completed. The students will graduate from high school and choose
their path in life.
